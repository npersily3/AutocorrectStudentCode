I am calling my approach the Ship of Theseus approach. Using the mistyped word as a backbone, I want to generate all possible words with an edit distance of some later to be determined threshold. I will think of each letter as a node in a graph, or a weighted graph where each weight is the weight assigned to either replace, add, delete. |

I played around with adding, subtracting and replacing every letter at every instance recursively, this nets an exponential time with a triple digit base. This leads me to believe that finding permutations of a certain edit distance away will take too long. I think iterating through the dictionary will is the best option so far. |

I will use tabulation to build up to the edit distance. Assuming a correctly filled out box above and to the left, the edit distance depends on if it is the same letter then the ed of the new cell is the north or west box - 1 otherwise it is the ceil of the averages of north and west. |
| March 9 | 830-900 pm  | I started actually coding. I am making a method that takes in two words and computes the edit distance using the dynamic algorithm described above. So far I have wwritten the code that populate the first row and column of the table. I start by computing the edit distance at table(0,0). Then for every remaining cell I check to see if the letters match if they do I see if they have match before. If they have not matched then the edit distance does not change from the cell before in all other cases it is the edit distance before + 1; |
