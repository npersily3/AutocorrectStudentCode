Using the mistyped word as a backbone, I want to generate all possible words with an edit distance of some later to be determined threshold. I will think of each letter as a node in a graph, or a weighted graph where each weight is the weight assigned to either replace, add, delete. |
| March 7 |   9-930   | I realized that a spelling bee approach will net some exponential time with no dynamic speedups. I played around with adding, subtracting and replacing every letter at every instance recursively, this nets an exponential time with a triple digit base. This leads me to believe that finding permutations of a certain edit distance away will take too long. I think iterating through the dictionary will is the best option so far. |
| March 7 | 930-1000  |            After receiving the hint that finding the edit distance is proportional to the length of the two words, I created a grid approach. I will use tabulation to build up to the edit distance. Assuming a correctly filled out box above and to the left, the edit distance depends on if it is the same letter then the ed of the new cell is the north or west box - 1 otherwise it is the ceil of the averages of north and west. |
