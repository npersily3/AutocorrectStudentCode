I am calling my approach the Ship of Theseus approach. Using the mistyped word as a backbone, I want to generate all possible words with an edit distance of some later to be determined threshold. I will think of each letter as a node in a graph, or a weighted graph where each weight is the weight assigned to either replace, add, delete. |

I played around with adding, subtracting and replacing every letter at every instance recursively, this nets an exponential time with a triple digit base. This leads me to believe that finding permutations of a certain edit distance away will take too long. I think iterating through the dictionary will is the best option so far. |

I will use tabulation to build up to the edit distance. Assuming a correctly filled out box above and to the left, the edit distance depends on if it is the same letter then the ed of the new cell is the north or west box - 1 otherwise it is the ceil of the averages of north and west. |

I am making a method that takes in two words and computes the edit distance using the dynamic algorithm described above. So far I have wwritten the code that populate the first row and column of the table. I start by computing the edit distance at table(0,0). Then for every remaining cell I check to see if the letters match if they do I see if they have match before. If they have not matched then the edit distance does not change from the cell before in all other cases it is the edit distance before + 1; |

I iterate through the table excluding the initial row and column of the table. I compare the letters at the indices. If they are the same then the edit distance should be the same as the diagonal. Initially it was the box to the left minus 1, but I realized that introducing two of the same letter should not change the edit distance at all so it should be equal to the case that excludes both of them. If they are not equal I take the ceiling of the average of the north and west cell. This was just a trend I noticed when writing examples. |

Then I added the code which runs the edit distance. Right now I iterate through every word in a given dictionary and if the edit distance is within a given threshold, I add the edit distance and string to an arraylist of valid words. I then sort my arrylist by edit distance and then alphabetically |

Now it works. I want to implement n-grams system. |

To combat this I created a new dictionary the has the words sorted by length and if the word has length of n or less I will iterate through all the words that are less than n to find a match or candidates. Otherwise I will generate n-grams |

I start by populating an initial arraylist of pairs with the first six words. Then, for each subsequent word if the edit distance is less than the last word in the initial array, I iterate through the array to insert it where it belongs. Finally I return the arraylist of pairs as an array of strings. |

I start by iterating through every word of length n or greater and calling the method generate ngrams. This method works by iterating at n and going until the end of the word. The in that loop I iterate N times to assemble an N-gram using char at. Finally, I return every n-gram as a list. In the main method when I recieve all the ngrams lists, I iterate through them and see if that ngram has been added. If it has I add the associated word to the list otherwise I create a list then add the word. In order to save time I am writing this hashmap to a file. |

Then, I abstracted my code so I initially populate candidates with a candidate of edit distance 100. Lastly, I started implementing using the table to generate candidates |

Added UI using scanner to mimic phone autocorrect. In each case, (small or big word) I added that if the the first word in the candidates array has an edit distance of zero return null. This allows me in main function to check in constant time if the word is already used. I might consider switching this to a trie late for an early exit. However, I think the assembly time would be very costly. |

I am switching from a hash table to an array with hash as indices and index in dict as value. This allows for things to be constant. |

I use a simple horner's method hash function. I use this in generate ngrams to make use of rabin carp so each ngram is generated in constant time. Finally This changes the way I write my table out. Now, I have a one hash at the start followed by indices of words containing that n-gram, and at the end I have negative one to signify the end of a list. |
| March 18 |    9-930    | I realized that for each list, I could use run length encoding to write it out more efficiently. This led me to transform my initTable to accomodate this change.

I realized that I had a tie break problem so instead of outputting six words, I output all the words less than a threshold. My threshold now is the length over n. |

I countered this by creating an arrayList to keep track of every string and running contains every time i want to check a new word. |

Then at the end I turn it into an array list of pairs and sort it. During this period I analyzed the runtime on the board. I do not know what to figure out what the number of words associated with an ngram is associated with. |


To add a new row to the table, click into a cell and then hit shift-enter.
